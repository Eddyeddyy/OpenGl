# OpenGl
OpenGl Project that shows off a 3D scene of my choice. This project demonstrates my knowledge of the OpenGl api.
I appraock my software design with an idea, start with some base code and build up on that code until I get
to a point where I am satisfied. With this project I started with building code that will generate a window and 
a simple triangle shape. Form there I changed the triangle for a 3D shape, then added a few more shapes, textured the shapes, and 
then finally added lighting. To result in the scene that you see in the project. 
I also keep in mind for repeating code that I can minimize by devolping and implementing functions.
Computer science really helps one understanding accuracy and with critical thinking. It is a mind set that will help out in future endeavors.
